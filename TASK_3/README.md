### TASK 2 -IRIS Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview: 

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements. 

## Problem Statement:

The Iris flower classification project is a fundamental machine learning task that involves using the well-known Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The Iris dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks because of its simplicity and ease of visualization. It is an excellent starting point for learning how to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world classification problems.

## Dataset Overview:

### The dataset includes the following features:

> Petal length: The length of petal in centimeters

> Petal width: The width of petal in centimeters

> Sepal length: The length of sepal in centimeters

> Sepal width: The width of sepal in centimeters

## Project Workflow:

1. Data preparation - By loading and cleaning dataset
